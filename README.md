Description:
The File Backup Script is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users back up their files from one folder to another. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's tkinter library, allowing users to select a source folder containing the files they want to back up and a destination folder where the files will be stored.

The script walks the user through selecting the source and destination folders using file dialogs, tracks the backup process using a progress bar, and displays success or error messages after the backup operation completes. This script also ensures that folder structures are preserved during the backup, making it a reliable solution for file and folder management.

Requirements:
To run this script, you need the following:

Python: The script is written in Python, so you will need Python installed on your system. Python 3.x is recommended.
Download from: python.org
Required Libraries:
tkinter: A standard Python library for GUI development.
shutil: A built-in Python library for file operations like copying files.
os: A standard library for interacting with the operating system, such as path manipulations.
These libraries come pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.

Instructions:
1. Running the Script:

Download or copy the script code into a Python file (e.g., file_backup.py).
Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
Run the script using the following command:
python file_backup.py
2. Using the GUI:

Step 1: When you run the script, a window will appear with the title "File Backup Tool".
Step 2: Click the "Select Folders and Start Backup" button.
Step 3: A file dialog will prompt you to select the source folder (the folder whose contents you want to back up).
Step 4: After selecting the source folder, another dialog will prompt you to choose the destination folder (the folder where you want to store the backup).
Step 5: The backup process will begin, and a progress bar will indicate the status of the backup. The script will copy files from the source folder to the destination folder while maintaining the folder structure.
Step 6: Once the backup is completed, a message will appear confirming the success of the operation, displaying the total number of files backed up.
Step 7: If thereâ€™s an error during the backup process, an error message will be displayed.
3. Backup Process:

The script reads all files in the source folder, including files in subdirectories, and copies them to the destination while maintaining the same folder structure.
The progress bar updates in real-time to show the number of files being backed up.
If any issues arise (e.g., permission errors, missing files), the script will handle them and provide a detailed error message.
4. Customization:

You can modify the script to customize the appearance of the GUI, such as changing button colors, text, or font styles.
The script currently performs a straightforward backup but can be extended to include features like file exclusion, incremental backups, or scheduling.
